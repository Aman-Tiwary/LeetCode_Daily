Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {

        int i = 0;
        int j = 1;
        int n = nums.size();

        while(j<n){ 
            if(nums[i]!=nums[j]){ //gets unique element
                i++;
                nums[i]=nums[j];
            }
            j++; 
        }
        return i+1;
        
    }
};
